 * Building blocks of sagas

 * corresponding undo action.  A saga is essentially a directed acyclic graph of
 * these actions with dependencies between them.  Each action consumes an
 * [`ActionContext`] and asynchronously produces an [`ActionResult`].  The
 * primary implementor for most consumers is [`crate::ActionFunc`].
 *
 * Actions should be stateless.  Any state is supposed to be stored via the
 * framework.  So it should be easy to make Actions Send and Sync.  This is
 * important because we want to be able to have multiple references to the same
 * Action in multiple threads -- as might happen if the same action appeared
 * multiple times in the saga or in different sagas.
